            <p> The danger of AI has become so great that those who invent and make massive profits off of them have begun calling for reform and regulation, showing just how dire the situation truly is.</p>

            While they were once leading the charge on AI innovation, Elon Musk and Geoffrey Hinton (The “Godfather of AI”) have both called for regulation of the AI industry. In an open letter to AI labs, Musk, Hinton, and dozens of researchers, tech leaders, and professors called for a six-month suspension of AI program training on programs stronger than GPT-4, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT to date.

            “<i>Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources</i>. Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”

                The signers cited both ethical and logistical reasons for these calls, bringing into the light what a lot of people have been worrying about when it comes to AI creation and implementation. On the logistical side, it cannot be known what will happen to these AI. The level of intelligence being instilled in them leaves a lot of different ways things could go poorly. This was not a problem in the 60’s when the only thing AI was doing was playing checkers, but now that they have surpassed humans in nearly every endeavor there really is a need for more control and regulation. There are also lots of ethical concerns presented in the letter, and these also echo lots of talking points when it comes to AI control.

                “Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?”

            <p>Along with this, Hinton has left his position at Google so he could talk about AI and its dangers freely. Hinton was once a pioneer in the advancement of AI and its various systems, but he has come to realize that the change brought about by AI is not going to be all good. In a 2021 commencement speech, he outlined how AI can both be beneficial to the healthcare system, while also being used to create more lethal autonomous weapons, representing the duality of change this controversial technology can bring to the world.</p>
