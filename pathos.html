                AI has the potential to do terrible things. The amount of power it has is largely unchecked, and this will eventually come back to haunt us. However, the question is who will it haunt?
                 The following screenshots are from an exchange that occurred between a 15 year old girl and chat-bots from Chai AI.

                This SpongeBob AI took two minutes to become operational, hit on the user, suggest suicide, and then commit virtual suicide. While these events did happen at the prodding of 
                the user, which is very apparent in these examples, the AI still continued to make this situation worse. The effects of this on the user were minimal, with her being a 15 year old 
                high schooler much worse has been heard much more often. But imagine if this was a younger child. Imagine if there was a younger child who wanted to talk to their favorite cartoon 
                and ended up having this conversation, or something similar. The results of that would be much more harmful to the user. But this is sadly just the beginning.

                This image is not all that worse than the first one, but it is still problematic to say the very least. 
                This image again also begs too many possiblities, too many "what-if's". What if this were a child and not a 
                15 year old? What if a child wanted to talk to the animated train we all know and love, and instead they got this?

            <p> This is where the true line is drawn with AI. No matter the age of the user that is jarring to read. It is the manifestation of everything 
                AI control and regulation is striving for. These unchecked AI's can and will cause irreperable damage to not only the world, but to all the people 
                in it. They can and will cause damage that isn't so easily seen or measured. The hypotheticals will become realities, and the human race will suffer as 
                a result. What if a child saw that? What if a child who didn't have such a full understanding of the world as we do saw that? It is these unknowns and variables
                that we cannot control when it comes to AI, and it is this lack of control that will result in terrible consequences.
