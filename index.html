        <section id="time">
            <p id="one">1921 - The word “robot” is first used in Czech writer Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). </p>
            <p id="two">1927 - Robot humanoid is first represented in film “Metropolis”. </p>
            <p id="three">1943 -  “A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity” is published in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics by Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts. This paper discussed networks of idealized and simplified artificial “neurons” and how they might perform simple logical functions, which provided the basis for “deep learning” AI technology, or more simply the first ideas on “mimicking the brain.” </p>
            <p id="four">1950 - “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess” is published by Claude Shannon, making it the first published article regarding the development of a chess-playing computer program. </p>
            <p id="five">1950 - Alan Turing publishes “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, which introduces to the world “the imitation game”. This is better known as the Turing Test </p>
            <p id="six">1951 - The first artificial neural network is created by Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmunds using 3000 vacuum tubes to simulate a network of 40 neurons. It was called SNARC (Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator). </p>
            <p id="seven">1952 - Christopher Strachey creates a machine capable of playing a full game of checkers at a reasonable speed, marking the first AI automated game to be made.</p>
            <p id="eight">1955 - Herbert Simon and Allen Newell develop the Logic Theorist, the first artificial intelligence program </p>
            <p id="nine">1956 - The Dartmouth Conference takes place. This was the first major discussion into AI and its potential, and it saw the coining of the term “artificial intelligence”. Topics discussed included neural networks, self-improvement, and the programming of a computer language. </p>
            <p id="ten">1959 - Arthur Samuel coins the term “machine learning,” writing a program for a computer “so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program.”</p>
            <p id="eleven">1961 - A General Motors plant in New Jersey houses the first industrial robot, Unimate, on their assembly line. </p>
            <p id="twelve">1965 - Joseph Weizenbaum develops ELIZA, an interactive program that carries on a dialogue in English language on any topic. This is the relative equivalent of the first chat-bot, like Chat-GPT but on a much smaller and less powerful scale, but the same concept.  </p>
            <p id="thirteen">1965 - DENDRAL begins development at Stanford University. The first expert system, it fully automated the decision-making process of organic chemists, and was used to study hypothesis formation and construct models of empirical induction.  </p>
            <p id="fourteen">1972 - The first medical-based computer system is created at Stanford. MYCIN was an early expert system that identified bacteria causing severe infections and recommended antibiotics. </p>
            <p id="fifteen">1979 - The Stanford Cart successfully crosses a chair-filled room without human intervention in about five hours, making it one of the earliest examples of an autonomous vehicle capable of making decisions in the real world and in the form of a robot-like machine. </p>
            <p id="sixteen">1980 - Wabot-2 is built at Waseda University in Japan. It was a humanoid robot able to communicate with humans, read a musical score, and play tunes of average difficulty on an electronic organ. </p>
            <p id="seventeen">1986 - First driverless car, a Mercedes-Benz van equipped with cameras and sensors drives up to 55 mph on empty streets in Munich. </p>
            <p id="eighteen">1988 - Rollo Carpenter develops the chat-bot Jabberwacky to “simulate natural human chat in an interesting, entertaining and humorous manner." This is a step closer to our modern AI’s, with human interaction with robots and programs slowly becoming more human in nature.  </p>
            <p id="nineteen">1997 - Reigning world chess champion and Grandmaster Garry Kasparov is defeated by Deep Blue, a computer program, in a chess match.  </p>
            <p id="twenty">1998 - Dave Hampton and Caleb Chung create Furby, the first pet robot. </p>
            <p id="twentyone">2000 -A robot that could recognize and simulate emotions by the name of Kismet is developed at MIT.  </p>
            <p id="twentytwo">2000 - Honda's robot ASIMO is able to walk as fast as a human and deliver trays to customers in a restaurant setting. </p>
            <p id="twentythree">2009 - Google starts development on a driverless car. </p>
            <p id="twentyfour">2011 - Watson, a natural language question answering computer, competes on Jeopardy! and defeats two former champions. </p>
            <p id="twentyfive">2011 - Researchers at the IDSIA in Switzerland report a 0.27% error rate in handwriting recognition done using artificial intelligence.  </p>
            <p id="twentysix">2014 - The above-mentioned driverless car from Google passes the Nevada state driver's test. </p>
