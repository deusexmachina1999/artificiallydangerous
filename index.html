        <section id="time">
            <p id="one">1921 - The word “robot” is first used in Czech writer Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's
                Universal Robots). </p>
            <p id="two">1927 - Robot humanoid is first represented in film “Metropolis”. (Image 1) </p>
            <p id="three">1943 - “A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity” is published in the
                Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics by Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts. This paper discussed
                networks of idealized and simplified artificial “neurons” and how they might perform simple logical
                functions, which provided the basis for “deep learning” AI technology, or more simply the first ideas on
                “mimicking the brain.” </p>
            <p id="four">1950 - “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess” is published by Claude Shannon, making it the
                first published article regarding the development of a chess-playing computer program. </p>
            <p id="five">1950 - Alan Turing (Image 2) publishes “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, which introduces
                to the world “the imitation game”. This is better known as the Turing Test </p>
            <p id="six">1951 - The first artificial neural network is created by Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmunds using
                3000 vacuum tubes to simulate a network of 40 neurons. It was called SNARC (Stochastic Neural Analog
                Reinforcement Calculator). </p>
            <p id="seven">1952 - Christopher Strachey creates a machine capable of playing a full game of checkers at a
                reasonable speed, marking the first AI automated game to be made.</p>
            <p id="eight">1955 - Herbert Simon and Allen Newell develop the Logic Theorist, the first artificial
                intelligence program </p>
            <p id="five">1956 - The Dartmouth Conference takes place. This was the first major discussion into AI and
                its potential, and it saw the coining of the term “artificial intelligence”. Topics discussed included
                neural networks, self-improvement, and the programming of a computer language. </p>
            <p id="nine">1959 - Arthur Samuel coins the term “machine learning,” writing a program for a computer “so
                that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the
                program.”</p>
            <p id="ten">1961 - A General Motors plant in New Jersey houses the first industrial robot, Unimate (Image
                3), on their assembly line. </p>
            <p id="six">1965 - Joseph Weizenbaum develops ELIZA, an interactive program designed to work like a
                psychotherapist. This is the relative equivalent of the first chat-bot, like Chat-GPT but on a much
                smaller and less powerful scale, but the same concept. </p>
            <p id="two">1965 - DENDRAL begins development at Stanford University. The first expert system, it fully
                automated the decision-making process of organic chemists, and was used to study hypothesis formation
                and construct models of empirical induction. </p>
            <p id="two">1972 - The first medical-based computer system is created at Stanford. MYCIN was an early
                expert system that identified bacteria causing severe infections and recommended antibiotics. </p>
            <p id="two">1979 - The Stanford Cart (Image 4) successfully crosses a chair-filled room without human
                intervention in about five hours, making it one of the earliest examples of an autonomous vehicle
                capable of making decisions in the real world and in the form of a robot-like machine. </p>
            <p id="five">1980 - Wabot-2 is built at Waseda University in Japan. It was a humanoid robot able to
                communicate with humans, read a musical score, and play tunes of average difficulty on an electronic
                organ. </p>
            <p id="two">1986 - First driverless car, a Mercedes-Benz van equipped with cameras and sensors drives
                up to 55 mph on empty streets in Munich. </p>
            <p id="ten">1988 - Rollo Carpenter develops the chat-bot Jabberwacky to “simulate natural human chat in
                an interesting, entertaining and humorous manner." This is a step closer to our modern AI’s, with human
                interaction with robots and programs slowly becoming more human in nature. </p>
            <p id="two">1997 - Reigning world chess champion and Grandmaster Garry Kasparov is defeated by Deep
                Blue, a computer program, in a chess match.(Image 5) </p>
            <p id="five">1998 - Dave Hampton and Caleb Chung create Furby, the first pet robot. </p>
            <p id="seven">2000 -A robot that could recognize and simulate emotions by the name of Kismet is
                developed at MIT. </p>
            <p id="five">2000 - Honda's robot ASIMO is able to walk as fast as a human and deliver trays to
                customers in a restaurant setting. </p>
            <p id="two">2009 - Google starts development on a driverless car. </p>
            <p id="seven">2011 - Watson, a natural language question answering computer, competes on Jeopardy! and
                defeats two former champions. (Image 7) </p>
            <p id="five">2011 - Researchers at the IDSIA in Switzerland report a 0.27% error rate in handwriting
                recognition done using artificial intelligence. </p>
            <p id="six">2014 - The above-mentioned driverless car from Google passes the Nevada state driver's
                test. </p>
